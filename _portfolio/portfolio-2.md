This Chatbot was developed during [Cohere Hackathon](https://lablab.ai/event/cohere-hackathon/menlo-park-lab/ask-quran) organized by [lablab.ai](lablab.ai). The goal of this project was to build a multilingual chatbot that can answer questions about the Quran. The chatbot is built using OpenAI’s LLM -> GPT-3 for response generation and Cohere’s LLM -> multilingual model for embeddings and Pinecone vector database for storing the embeddings of Quran.

User can query in 100+ Languages and get answer in 100+ languages.
