This Project was developed during a Datathon competition organized by **Codanics** to analyze the sentiment of tweets and Texts in Realtime. The tweets are fetched using Twitter API and then analyzed using a pre-trained model called Vader. We have also used the Text blob model to classify the text. Web App has three pages. We have also analyzed dataset taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tweet-sentiment-extraction/).
