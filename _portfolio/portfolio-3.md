Built the Multilingual chatbot as customer representative to answer the question to customer regarding company’s information, policies, queries etc. Project was built during [OpenAI Hackathon](https://lablab.ai/event/openai-hackathon/menlo-park-lab/chatty-panda).

We used OpenAI’s GPT 3 model for response generation and OpenAI’s ada 002 embeddings model to create embeddings and store them in Chroma Vector database.
